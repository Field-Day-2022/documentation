## Attendees
- Dr. Bateman 
- Jack Norman
- Dennis Grassl

## Topics Covered

### DB Migration
Dr. Bateman was presented with the team's plan to migrate Fieldday data to the free tier of Firebase.
She was pleased with the no-cost solution, but expressed concern about data migration taking longer than expected (based on experience with previous capstone teams).
This can then lead to poorly-documented functionality or shortcomings in other areas of development, with teams starting over more or less from scratch each dev cycle.
She was also concerned about future access to the data, given that the previously-used AWS account was tied to her email, whereas the new solution will use a separate "admin" email.
Team addressed this concern, assuring Dr. Bateman that she will receive credentials to the account.

### Documentation Format
Team informed Dr. Bateman that .md will be used as the documentation format, which is easier for future teams to work with and expand upon than .pdf.
This should mitigate some of the concerns listed above.

### AZ Game and Fish Data Format
Once toe-clip document is completed, team will begin working on matching the schema required by the AZ Game and Fish dept reports.

### Next Meeting
Dr. Bateman will be on the road until Nov 9, so communication will be through slack until then.
Next meeting will (tentatively) take place around this time, depending on team's progress.
