# Features to be implemented
- [ ] Move all data to Firebase and update the API accordingly
	- this will meet the design goal of free DB hosting
- [ ] Input validation (do this upon keyup, not when next is pressed? Or when the input loses focus?)
- [ ] Data collection time is not correct
- [ ] Generate AZ Game and Fish Dept report automatically
- [ ] Provide consistent documentation in .md format for future teams
- [ ] SVL should be 1 decimal place, rounded to nearest 0.5g so only .0 and .5 should be permitted
- [ ] Make it more clear that a session is over
- [ ] Recapture column in web UI should be T/F instead of True/False
- [ ] Need to be able to edit column names and rename species names in the web UI because they change periodically throughout the years
- [ ] Need a merge button in the web UI for merging sessions together
