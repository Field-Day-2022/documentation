The Web UI is meant to be a way of viewing the database from a desktop computer at home connected to the Internet.  In order to start up the Web UI locally as a developer:

1. Download the [Web UI repository](https://github.com/Field-Day-2022/field-day-2022-webUI) if you haven't already and check out the branch you want to work on
2. In the Web UI directory, open a terminal
3. Enter the following command:
> npm run dev
4. Go to the URL provided in the terminal (by default, the current version of Vite makes this http://localhost:5173/)
5. Login with your ASU email.  This will be authenticated by Google, so it must be valid.
