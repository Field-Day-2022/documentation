# General Team Notes

### Git Policies
- Two reviews before a merge into main
- Dev branch before main
	- Require 1 peer review for merge into dev
- .gitignore for all generated files
- Readme with basic operation info in top-level directory
- No source files in top-level directory

### Coding Standards
 - No tab characters
	- 4 spaces
- Blank new line at the end of all files

### Extras
- Github Repository
- Should we enable CI? (If feasible)
- Github projects for task management?
- Design mockups with Figma?
- We should try to keep our messages on slack grouped in threads as best we can. Easy to bury important information if we don't.
