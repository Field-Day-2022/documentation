# Team Meeting 2

## Attendees
- Ian Skelskey
- Isaiah Lathem
- Jack Norman
- Zachary Jacobson

## Topics

### Future Meetings
Should we set up a recurring meeting schedule? Maybe we could create another excel sheet to indicate our recurring availability and set a couple of weekly meeting times that work for most of us. We may also want to have a meeting attendance policy like each team member should be present at a minimum of one team meeting per week.

### Repeating Meeting Times (Daily)
Early Huddle - 9 AM Arizona Time
Late Huddle - 6:30 PM Arizona Time

Distribute work for project plan among team members

## [GitHub Project](https://github.com/users/IanSkelskey/projects/7)

This is our task board. It is currently populated with all due dates from Canvas. Ian can walk us through this as needed.

## Slack Policies

Our slack channel is getting a little crowded. We should consider ways to divide up communication. As usual, threads help, but we may need additional considerations.

### For Example:

General Communication/Meetings - **Slack**
Research/Resources - **Google Drive or GitHub Projects**

## Coding/Git Policies

We should create a document that defines all of our teamâ€™s policies and have all team members sign it to ensure adherence and quality.
