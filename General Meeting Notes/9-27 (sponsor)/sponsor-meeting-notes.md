# Notes

- Improvements to make:
  - Input validation (do this upon keyup, not when next is pressed?)
  - Data collection time is not correct
  - Overall quality of life improvements

- Other notes
  - Carlos team app is the live version
  - Carlos team has the data for the database
  - Contact Carlos for technical stuff
  - Need to have a demo quickly to start iterating on it
  - prototypes
  - can we use mockups in figma to iterate on UI prototypes?
  - Won’t need to use the app until the spring
  - Mobile app is taking the place of the data sheets
  - Data entry order is important in reducing errors
  - Capture, Mark, Recapture - keep track of population growth, trends, wet vs dry years, climate change implications, etc.
  - She might want us to just refine the existing app
  - Virgin River is inactive, 6 years of data that can be not used
  - Gateway is infrequently used (not in the summer)
  - San Pedro has 3 years of data (holding onto it waiting for something to happen)
    - these are different projects, but the last team called them locations
  - They process the data manually
  - One potential feature is automating and creating trends
  - Right now, the time of data collection is creating when the phone connects to the internet, not at time of data entry 
  - Array = bunch of traps
  - We need to implement form validation
  - Running totals (session entry counts) is important for telling the team if a species has been counted yet
  - Species code list can be added to in the web ui
  - Toe clip code is for keeping track of if the animal has been counted already, they clip the lizards toe, it doesn’t grow back
  - recapture history is important
  - SVL should be 1 decimal place
  - VTl should be an integer
  - OTL should be <= VTL
  - Verify page is very important (QA QC)
  - Every toe clip code is unique to each animal in the species in that location (unique key constraint is toe clip code, species, and location together)
  - need to be able to rename species names in the web ui (can do with 1 mutation) because they change periodically
  - Different species collect different kinds of the data, so the input pages will be different
  - End session should be a button, add verification to make sure they really want to end the session (have you counted all your critters yet?)
  - Unsync history should have list of sessions to add to previous data that day (maybe add edit functionality to only the prof user data)
  - location + site + array is 1 session
  - session data is editable from web ui only
  - keeping phone entry point and web ui separate 
  - make it work best with bright sunlight out in the desert 
  - things to be improved
  - recapture column should be T or F instead of true/false
  - merge button for merging multiple sessions together
